I'm a software developer and overall pretty cool guy. This blog is where I pretend to be an expert at things.

I currently work for [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) and live in Seattle, WA.

I dig functional languages like [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [Purescript](https://www.purescript.org/), but also love the 'second best for everything' language that is Python.

My big Open Source claim to fame is creating [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey).

Want me to build something for you? Hit me up! I lack loyalty to my current gig and am powered by a constant greedy desire for mo' money (and solving mo' problems).

Want Gooey releases to be churned out faster? [Sponsor its development](https://www.patreon.com/chriskiehl)!

Just wanna chat? Drop me a line at [ckiehl@gmail.com](mailto:ckiehl@gmail.com). If you're a
recruiter, feel free to message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-kiehl-34426587/).
You can also follow me on [Github](https://github.com/chriskiehl), which is the extent of my Social Media.
