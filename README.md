The public facing side is made up of 3-4 simple views. The fun stuff is all in the Admin section. I wanted it to have a similar feel to writing on [medium](www.medium.com), so a good amount of work went into making the Django admin section not totally awful. Also, that admin work has been spun off into a seperate plugin project called [Dropler](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Dropler)!
